<b><h1>POM</h1></b>
Performance Optimizer for Microsoft Windows
#
simply run the script as admin in cmd by: <code>python main.py</code>
<br><br>It will create a system restore point in Windows automatically. In case of restarting, the script creates a lock.txt so it doesn't create a system restore point every time the scripts starts.


You will have plenty of options what to do. But the best is to choose [9]!

<br>
The menu will look like this!

<b>POM - Performance Optimizer <br>This script will only work on Windows Systems! <br>[1] Clear only System temporary files <br>[2] Clear only Profile temporary files <br>[3] Disable SysMain service <br>[4] Clear only Prefetch <br>[5] Clear Windows Update Downloads <br>[6] Check Roaming folder size <br>[7] Check system drive C <br> <br>[9] Run everything <br>[0] Exit</b>

Thanks for using my script and have fun!
